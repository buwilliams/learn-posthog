# Learn PostHog's Tech Stack

This repo is where I'm working on sample projects to help me learn the technical stack of PostHog. I'm an experienced developer but I haven't either used the technology or haven't used it in so many years I've forgotten most of it. So while I'm a great developer, I don't know these technologies. That's totally okay, they hired me with that in mind.

## A note about learning styles

Some people like to jump in. Some people like to comprehend. I'm the later. So, I approach learning by separating the various learning concerns and take them in turn.

## Things to learn

- [ ] [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- [ ] [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)
- [x] [Kea](https://kea.js.org/docs/introduction/what-is-kea)
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] [Python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
- [ ] [Django](https://www.feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)
- [ ] Clickhouse

## Docs

- [Create React App](docs/create_react_app.md)
- [Kea](docs/kea.md)
- [Python](docs/python.md)

## What has helped me

First thing to remember is that, it's like beginning a book in the middle of a series where the 
characters are well formed. There is so much going on.

> “You don’t care about the answer until you have the question.”

- Reading the [project structure doc](https://posthog.com/docs/project-structure). This helped me navigate the codebase.
- Browsing the [issues in GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues) by playing with the various labels. This helped me get a better feel for their communication style.
- Getting a task assignment. Struggling to complete the assignment helped me to *have the question* from the quote above.
- Pairing with Tim & Eric. They used devtools to examine network traffic, console.log, and I was able to ask specific questions.
- Reading the kea docs. This is *clutch* to understand the frontend. This not hard and rather nice but you won't make progress without understanding Kea.
- Creating a simple app with create-react-app with typescript support `yarn create react-app learn-kea-typescript --template typescript`
- Talking with Eltje (she’s incredible) about not getting burned out quickly

> "So, what?!"

- Often I felt anxious about the little amount of my daily contributions. Using the quote above really helps deal with this kind of anxiety. So what if I suck. I'm an expert and in time I'll be a great asset.

> "When you are working, close your email and slack. No one is watching to see if you are online. In fact, it's the opposite."

- Tim (CTO) told me this early on and it was liberating. It allowed me to think of my role as a true `async` open-source contributor. Do what needs to be done so that you can be the most effective.
