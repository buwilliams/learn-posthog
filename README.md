# Learn PostHog's Tech Stack

This repo is where I'm working on sample projects to help me learn the tech stack at PostHog. I'm an experienced developer and new to most of PostHog's tech stack.

## A note about learning styles

Some people like to jump in. Some people like to read the docs. I'm the later. My plan is simple spend part of the time accomplishing work given to me and part of the time reading.

## Things to learn

- [x] [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- [x] [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)
- [x] [Kea](https://kea.js.org/docs/introduction/what-is-kea)
- [ ] [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ ] [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [ ] [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [ ] [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/)

## Great places to learn

### Python

- [Python via LearnXinYminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
- [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/)
- [Two Scoops of Django (e-book)](https://www.feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)

## What has helped me

First thing to remember: starting a new job is like beginning a book in the middle of a 
series where the characters are well formed and the story is far along. It's fair to say, 
you have no idea what is going on. You can read words and understand but not understand 
why they are being said.

*My goal is to develop a solid mental model for the codebase.*

> “You don’t care about the answer until you have the question.” - Unknown

- On my first day, I was given an assignment to work on. It began the process of showing me what I needed to learn. Struggling to complete the assignment helped me to *have the question* from the quote above.
- Reading the [project structure doc](https://posthog.com/docs/project-structure)
- Browsing the [issues in GitHub](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues) by playing with the various labels. This helped me get a better feel for PostHog's communication style and open-mindedness.
- Pairing with Tim & Eric. They used devtools to examine network traffic, console.log, and I was able to ask specific questions. It was basic stuff and reminded me to use the basic tools I've been using for years. I guess the anxiety of a new job confused my brain a little.
- Reading the kea docs. This is *clutch* to understand the frontend. It's a rather nice library but you won't make progress without understanding Kea.
- Creating a simple app with create-react-app with typescript support `yarn create react-app learn-kea-typescript --template typescript`

> "Take care of yourself. There's no need to burnout in the first month." - Eltje

- Eltje encouraged me to take care of myself, so I did.

> "So, what?!" - [Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Anxiety-Stop-Panic-Attacks/dp/0956596258/) where "D" stands for defuse the anxiety by considering the worst and saying so what.

- Often I felt anxious about my daily contributions. Using the quote above really helps deal with this kind of anxiety. So what if I fail to deliver these assignments timely?! I'm an expert and in time I'll be a great asset to PostHog.
- Additionally, it's important to remember to trust the process. Being new (bad) at something isn't a great feeeling initially until you realize that it's a part of the process. Soon you'll be good. It's better to reframe and remember that you only get to have new eyes once. Plus, it's fun to learn new things.

> "When you are working, close your email and slack. No one is watching to see if you are online. In fact, it's the opposite." - Tim, CTO

- Tim told me this on the first or second day and it was liberating. It allowed me to think of my role as a true `async` open-source contributor. Do what needs to be done so that you can be the most effective.

> Read the docs

- For my learning style, this has been a **must**. I'm keeping a list of resources for learning I've used.
- I also spent time creating projects as you see in this repo. These helps me reenforce and consolidate the knowledge I was gaining.
